Welcome to Seco
=================

Seco is a free, open-source scripting environment for the Java platform. 

For more information, please visit http://www.kobrix.com/seco.jsp.

Licensing information may be found in the LicensingInformation file in this
directory. Note that the embedded BerkeleyDB is governed by a different license
- see BERKELEYDB_LICENSE.txt.

Requirements
============

Seco needs Java 6 to run, and as of version 0.5 does not require any native 
anymore so it should work on any Java-compatible platform. 


Running Seco
==================

Edit the startup script to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. The startup 
script depends on your platform: run.cmd for Windows and run.sh for Unix. On Unix
you may need to set execute permissions with 'chmod +x run.sh'.
The JAVA_HOME variable may point to a JDK installation or to a JRE installation. 
Then run the file from anywhere in your computer. A welcome screen will appear 
and explain what to do next.

HAVE FUN!
